EDIFACT VS X12

1.Control Characters
    Segment Terminator (~)
	Element Separator (*)
	Subelement Separator (>)
	Repetition Separator (^)
	Escape Character (?)

	In X12, the control characters may be specified at the interchange level using ISA11 and ISA16 segments, allowing for flexibility in their definition.

	X12 has a more rigid structure compared to EDIFACT, with fixed-length data elements and predefined segment sequences for each transaction set.

			tag--->desc
			mandatory----->required
			length---->min and max length (for some of the segments they have not given min max length)
			There is no reference attribute in X12 SD
